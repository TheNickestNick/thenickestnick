- 👋 Hi, I’m @thenickestnick
- 👀 I’m interested in generative AI models of all kinds (2d, 3d, audio, text; you name it, I'm interested in it).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build and finetune diffusion models, and build applications based on them.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things related to generative models. In case you hadn't noticed, I am interested in those :)
- 📫 How to reach me: nickestofnicks@gmail.com
